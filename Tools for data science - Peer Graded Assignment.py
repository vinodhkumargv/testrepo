# ## Arithmetic Expression Examples
# 
# In this section, we will explore some common arithmetic expressions used in programming and mathematics. These expressions involve basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. Below are a few examples:
# 
# - **Addition**: `5 + 3 = 8`
# - **Subtraction**: `10 - 4 = 6`
# - **Multiplication**: `7 * 2 = 14`
# - **Division**: `20 / 4 = 5`
# - **Exponentiation**: `2 ^ 3 = 8`
# - **Modulus**: `10 % 3 = 1`
#

# Multiply and Add Numbers

# Define the numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 3
num3 = 7

# Multiply num1 and num2
product = num1 * num2

# Add the result to num3
result = product + num3

# Output the result
result


# In[2]:


# Convert Minutes to Hours

# Define the number of minutes
minutes = 150

# Convert minutes to hours
hours = minutes / 60

# Output the result
hours


# ## Objectives
# 
# The objectives of this notebook are:
# 
# - To understand basic arithmetic operations and their applications.
# - To explore how to convert units, such as minutes to hours, using simple programming techniques.
# - To demonstrate the use of code cells for performing mathematical operations.
# - To showcase the ability to work with both Python and Markdown cells in a notebook environment.
